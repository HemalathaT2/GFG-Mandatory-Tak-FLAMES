# GFG-Mandatory-Task-FLAMES
This is a fun program to play FLAMES(Friends, Love, Affection, Marriage, Enemy, Siblings) game for two people. 
The Rule is pretty simple. The common letters in the two names are eliminated and the flames loop in run throughout the remaining letters. The letters left at last is printed.

1. Here in this code, First I have added both the strings
2. I have replaced the common letters with "" so that it can be eliminated. 
3. Counted the remaining string's length.
4. Found the remainder of the string when divided by 6(As FLAMES contains 6 letters).
5. If rem=0, Siblings is printed.
6. If rem=1, Friends is printed.
7. If rem=2, Love is printed.
8. If rem=3, Affection is printed.
9. If rem=4, Marriage is printed.
10. If rem=5, Enemy is printed.
